# Exploring Ship Logbooks 3/7/2016
## Standup Presentation

### Progress this period:
- Successfully separated all ship logs into individual voyages by ship name, 
start and end locations, and time difference between logs (will use this for visualization and quantification)
- Decided to write classification algorithm to determine if voyages that do not explicity mention slaves in logs might be related to slave trade
- Added a second data set that is explicity logs of slave ships - excellent training data!
- Have template for classifier, need to fine-tune parameters and training data selection for NON slave ships

### Deliverables for next period:
- Complete and test classification
- Poster!

### Challenges to making next deliverables:
- New data set must be loaded in R
- Historical background - how to check that classifier works?
- Adjusting parameters to classifier to get best results.
