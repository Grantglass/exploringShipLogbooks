# Exploring Ship Logbooks 3/7/2016
## Standup Presentation

### Progress this period:
- Successfully separated all ship logs into individual voyages by ship name, 
start and end locations, and time difference between logs
- Determined how many voyages explicitly mention slaves in logs
- Decided to write classification algorithm to determine if other voyages might be related
- Researched and began work on classifier and encoding of categorical values

### Deliverables for next period:
- Complete and test classification
- Poster!

### Challenges to making next deliverables:
- Historical background - how to check that classifier works?
- Adjusting parameters to classifier to get best results.
